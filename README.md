This is an university project between the course Software Engineering. Briefly what is it about. This project name is "cooperation". It's about different firms what can  suggest their services to university for example. We are storing data about those firms, about details of their work, about their contact person, about persons who lead the projects and so on. The main goal of this project was to create a GUI application in Java which allows us to easily see, add, edit and delete data from databaze. Since I am studying in Czech university the whole project is written in Czech language, even the name of the methods and classes.
